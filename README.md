# Unity-Game
VR Maze Game

The game, designed for the Oculus Go, was made with Unity and C#.

The necessary libraries were removed from the original folder for the purpose of space conservation.

The first version exists without the "Duck Spider" boss, but the rules of the game remain the same.

Navigate through the maze and collect as many coins as possible while avoiding possible traps.

With the second version, use the Go controller to fire snails at the Duck Spiders.
